IOS Version of BMI App

This is the IOS Swift version of the class BMI App. It has been integrated with Health Kit so any data entered in the app is stored in healthkit, it also takes data from a mongo database and stores it in default storage, the table view takes data from the default storage. There is also a menu that is used to navigate to either of the two interfaces.
Enjoy.
