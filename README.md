# BMIProject
IOS Version of BMI App

This is the IOS Swift version of a BMI App, it has been integrated with Health Kit so any data entered in the app is stored in healthkit, it also takes data from a mongo database and stores it in default storage, the table view takes data from the default storage. There is also a menu that is used to navigate to either of the two interfaces.
Enjoy.
